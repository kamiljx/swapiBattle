  <h2>The application allows for randomly selecting people or starships and comparing them based on a common attribute: mass for people and crew size for starships. On a simple web interface, details of two random cards are displayed, and the winner is automatically determined based on the higher attribute. Users can play again by clicking an action button that fetches new random people or starships for comparison.</h2>
